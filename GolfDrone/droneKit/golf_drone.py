simple_goto.py: GUIDED mode "simple goto" example (Copter Only)

Demonstrates how to arm and takeoff in Copter and how to navigate to points using Vehicle.simple_goto.

Convenience functions for sending immediate/guided mode commands to control the Copter.

The set of commands demonstrated here include:
* MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW - set direction of the front of the Copter (latitude, longitude)
* MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI - set direction where the camera gimbal is aimed (latitude, longitude, altitude)
* MAV_CMD_DO_CHANGE_SPEED - set target speed in metres/second.


The full set of available commands are listed here:

def condition_yaw(heading, relative=False):

    Send MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW message to point vehicle at a specified heading (in degrees).

    This method sets an absolute heading by default, but you can set the `relative` parameter
    to `True` to set yaw relative to the current yaw heading.

    By default the yaw of the vehicle will follow the direction of travel. After setting
    the yaw using this function there is no way to return to the default yaw "follow direction
    of travel" behaviour (https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/issues/2427)

Functions to make it easy to convert between the different frames-of-reference. In particular these
make it easy to navigate in terms of "metres from the current position" when using commands that take
absolute positions in decimal degrees.

The methods are approximations only, and may be less accurate over longer distances, and when close
to the Earth's poles.

Specifically, it provides:
* get_location_metres - Get LocationGlobal (decimal degrees) at distance (m) North & East of a given LocationGlobal.
* get_distance_metres - Get the distance between two LocationGlobal objects in metres
* get_bearing - Get the bearing in degrees to a LocationGlobal

    Returns a LocationGlobal object containing the latitude/longitude `dNorth` and `dEast` metres from the

    as `original_location`.

    The function is useful when you want to move the vehicle around specifying locations relative to
    the current vehicle position.

    The algorithm is relatively accurate over small distances (10m within 1km) except close to the poles.
